           <h2> Database Design:</h2>

Database design is the process of creating a detailed data model of a database. It involves defining the structure of the database, specifying the relationships between data elements, and optimizing the database for performance and efficiency. Key aspects of database design include:

<h3>Database Schema Design</h3>
Database schema design is the process of defining the structure, organization, and relationships of data in a database. It is a critical aspect of database development as it determines how data will be stored, accessed, and managed. A well-designed database schema ensures data integrity, efficiency, and scalability of the database system. 
<h3>Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling: </h3> ER modeling is a technique used to visualize and design databases using entities (objects), attributes (properties of entities), and relationships between entities. It helps to define the overall structure and constraints of the database.
     
           
           
           <h2> Database Models:</h2>

Database models define the logical structure of a database and determine how data is stored, organized, and manipulated. There are several types of database models, each with its own approach to organizing data:

<h3>Hierarchical Model:</h3> In this model, data is organized in a tree-like structure where each record has a single parent and multiple children. This model was popular in early database systems but has limitations in flexibility and scalability.

<h3>Network Model:</h3> Similar to the hierarchical model, the network model allows records to have multiple parent and child records, forming a more complex graph-like structure. It addresses some limitations of the hierarchical model but can be complex to manage.

<h3>Relational Model: </h3>The relational model, based on mathematical set theory, is the most widely used today. It organizes data into tables (relations) where each table consists of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). Relationships between tables are established through keys, enabling efficient querying and ensuring data integrity.

<h3>Object-Oriented Model: </h3>This model extends the relational model to include object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It is used to store complex data types and is suitable for object-oriented programming languages.

<h3>Document Model: </h3>Document databases store data in flexible, self-describing document formats such as JSON or XML. They are designed to handle semi-structured and unstructured data and are commonly used in web applications and content management systems.

<h3>Key-Value Model:</h3> Key-value stores store data as a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a value. They are simple and efficient for storing and retrieving data but are limited in querying capabilities compared to other models.
