 <h2> Data Security:</div></h2>
<h3>Level 1 - Physical Security:</h3>

Concerned with securing physical access to data storage devices, servers, and data centers.
<h3>Level 2 - Human Security:</h3>

Involves policies and procedures to ensure that personnel handling data follow security protocols and practices.
<h3>Level 3 - Operating System (OS) Security:</h3>

Measures to secure the operating systems of computers and servers against unauthorized access and attacks.
<h3>Level 4 - Network Security:</h3>

Techniques and technologies used to protect data during transmission over networks, including encryption and firewalls.
<h3>Level 5 - Application Security:</h3>

Securing software applications and APIs from vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.
<h2>Data Integrity Constraints:</h2>
<h3>Entity Integrity Constraint:</h3>

Ensures that no primary key attribute in a table is null, thereby maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of records.
<h3>Domain Integrity Constraint:</h3>

Enforces valid data types, ranges, or formats for data stored in a database to prevent invalid data entry.
<h3>Referential Integrity Constraint:</h3>

Ensures relationships between tables remain consistent by enforcing foreign key constraints, preventing actions that would destroy links between tables.
<h2>Anomalies:</h2>
<h3>Insertion Anomaly:</h3>

Occurs when certain attributes cannot be added to the database without the presence of other attributes.
<h3>Deletion Anomaly:</h3>

Happens when deleting certain data also unintentionally removes other data that should remain in the database.
<h3>Update Anomaly:</h3>

Arises when updating data results in inconsistencies due to failure to update all occurrences of the data.
      <br><br>
These categories provide a structured way to understand and address different aspects of data management and security, ensuring that data remains secure, accurate, and consistent throughout its lifecycle.
