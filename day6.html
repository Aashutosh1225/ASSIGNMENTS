        <h2> Data Manipulation Language (DML)</h2>
        Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manage and manipulate data within 
        database objects such as tables. DML commands are essential for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data stored in
         the database. These commands are the primary means of interacting with and managing the actual data.<br>

<h2>Key DML Commands</h2>

<h3>SELECT:</h3>
Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.<br>
Example:<br>
Selecting all columns from the "employees" table..<br>

 <h3>INSERT:</h3>
 Used to add new rows of data to a table.<br>
Examples:<br>
Inserting a new row into the "employees" table with specific values for each column.

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>
Used to modify existing data within a table.<br>
Example:<br>
Updating the hire date of an employee in the "employees" table.

 <h3>DELETE:</h3>
 Used to remove rows of data from a table.<br>
Example: <br>
Deleting a specific employee's record from the "employees" table based on their employee ID.

<h2>Characteristics of DML Commands</h2>
<h3>Transactional:</h3> 
DML commands can be rolled back or committed, allowing for greater control over data manipulation and consistency.
<h3>Data Handling: </h3>
These commands are used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data, making them crucial for day-to-day database operations.
<h3>Conditional operation: </h3>
DML commands often include WHERE clauses to specify conditions for data manipulation, providing precise control over which rows are affected.
